                    <h2 style="color: white; border: none;">What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
                    <p>Cloud Computing is a type of technology that provides remote services on the internet to manage, access, and store data rather than storing it on Servers or local drives. This technology is also known as <span class="highlight" style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.3);">Serverless technology</span>. Here the data can be anything like Image, Audio, video, documents, files, etc.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Need of Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>Before using Cloud Computing, most of the large as well as small IT companies use traditional methods i.e. they store data in Server, and they need a separate Server room for that. In that Server Room, there should be a database server, mail server, firewalls, routers, modems, high net speed devices, etc. For that IT companies have to spend lots of money. In order to reduce all the problems with cost Cloud computing come into existence and most companies shift to this technology.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>üîí Security Issues in Cloud Computing</h2>
                <p>While Cloud Computing provides various advantages, there are several security issues that organizations must address:</p>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>1. Multi-Tenancy Risks</h4>
                    <p>In cloud computing, multiple users (or tenants) share the same physical infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networks. While virtualization ensures logical separation between tenants, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can lead to data leakage between users. For example, a flaw in hypervisor security could allow one tenant to access another tenant's data. Ensuring strong isolation through robust hypervisors, access controls, and encryption is crucial to prevent such cross-tenant attacks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>2. Data Breaches</h4>
                    <p>A data breach occurs when sensitive or confidential information is accessed, viewed, or stolen by unauthorized entities. In the cloud, data is often stored on third-party servers, increasing the risk if proper security measures are not implemented. Common causes include weak authentication, poor encryption, and insecure data transmission. A breach can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal penalties. To mitigate this, organizations use end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>3. Data Loss</h4>
                    <p>Data loss happens when data is accidentally deleted, corrupted, or becomes inaccessible. It can occur due to human error, malicious attacks (like ransomware), or failures in the cloud provider's systems. Even though many cloud providers offer redundancy and backup mechanisms, accidental overwriting or deletion can still occur. To prevent this, users should regularly back up their data, implement version control, and use multiple storage locations or regions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>4. Account Hijacking</h4>
                    <p>Account hijacking involves unauthorized access to a user's cloud account, typically through stolen login credentials, phishing attacks, or weak passwords. Once compromised, an attacker can steal data, manipulate configurations, or use cloud resources for malicious purposes (like cryptojacking). Preventive measures include enforcing strong password policies, using multi-factor authentication (MFA), monitoring login activities, and educating users about phishing and social engineering.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>5. Insecure APIs</h4>
                    <p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the primary channels through which cloud services are managed and accessed. If these APIs are poorly designed or lack proper authentication, they become a major entry point for attackers. Exploiting insecure APIs can lead to data leaks, unauthorized actions, or system compromise. Cloud providers and clients must ensure APIs are secured through authentication, input validation, encryption, and regular vulnerability testing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>6. Insider Threats</h4>
                    <p>Not all threats come from outside ‚Äî insiders such as employees, contractors, or cloud provider staff may misuse their access privileges to steal or damage data. These threats can be intentional (malicious insiders) or accidental (careless employees). Insider threats are difficult to detect because insiders already have authorized access. Countermeasures include implementing strict access controls, monitoring user activities, using least-privilege principles, and enforcing logging and auditing systems.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-issue">
                    <h4>7. Compliance and Legal Risks</h4>
                    <p>Cloud data often crosses international borders, which means it may fall under different legal and regulatory frameworks. Failure to comply with data protection laws (such as GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO standards) can result in fines and reputational damage. Organizations must ensure their cloud providers adhere to relevant compliance standards, maintain transparency about data storage locations, and establish clear contractual terms about data ownership, privacy, and security responsibilities.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">

                <h3>Access Control Models</h3>

                <div class="access-control-model">
                    <h4>1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> RBAC assigns permissions based on roles within an organization. Each role has a predefined set of permissions.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Admin Role: Can create, delete, or modify cloud resources<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Developer Role: Can deploy and test applications but not delete infrastructure<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Viewer Role: Can view resources but cannot make changes
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to manage permissions at scale</li>
                        <li>Enforces consistent security policies</li>
                        <li>Reduces the risk of privilege escalation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="access-control-model">
                    <h4>2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> ABAC determines access based on attributes of users, resources, and the environment. It is context-aware.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Types of Attributes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Attributes:</strong> Department, job title, clearance level</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Attributes:</strong> Data classification, file owner, project tag</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Attributes:</strong> Time of day, location, device type, IP address</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> "Allow access to financial records only if the user's department is 'Finance', the request comes from the corporate network, and it's within business hours."
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides more flexibility and precision than RBAC</li>
                        <li>Automatically adapts to context changes</li>
                        <li>Ideal for large, dynamic, multi-cloud environments</li>

                    <h4>a) Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h4>
                    <p>IAM is the foundation of cloud security that governs who can access what in the cloud environment. It ensures that only authenticated and authorized users or services can perform specific actions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Techniques:</strong> RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Authentication: Passwords, MFA, Biometrics</li>
